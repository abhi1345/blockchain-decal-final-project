1. How is web3 used in componentDidMount?
How does the user connect to the blockchain network?
This is metamask!

componentDidMount uses web3 to get the users's accounts and contract information.
The blockchain network is connected to using the MerchToken json file we copy-pasted.
We get the tags and merchTypes from this network.

2. pick one function: fetchLoot, addLoot, or buyLoot and explain in detail what it is doing and how it works.
Every line please

fetchLoot:
1. We start by initializing 2 empty arrays, available and owned. We also get the variable numTokens from the ethereum contract.
2. Then, we initialize a loop that runs for numTokens iterations.
3. At each iteration, we query a token, tokenId, and the owner of the token. We add the token name, price, id, and other information to a data structure.
4. If the owner is the first user on the state's accounts array, we push this data structure onto the owned array.
5. If the token is for sale, we push it onto the available array.
6. After the loop finishes, we update the state with the new available and owned arrays.
